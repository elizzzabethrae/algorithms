1. A real life example of a linear search would be looking through my emails from today to find one titled "Meeting Minutes".

2. An example of a binary search is trying to find a library book in the fiction section by author's last name. Its a good idea to start in the middle and see where to go from there.

3. 7 iterations.

4. 3 iterations.

5. To search through an unsorted collection of a million items, even though it would take forever, you would use a linear search. Due to it being unsorted, a binary search would not work.

5. Searching through a sorted collection of a million items, you would use a binary search to find a value. It would be much faster because it does not have to iterate through each item, it uses the halving method to find the value. 

function binarySearch (collection, word) {
  var low = 0;
  var high = collection.length-1;
  var word = word.toLowerCase();

  while (low <= high) {
    var mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
    if (collection[mid] > word) {
      var high = mid - 1;
    } else if (collection[mid] < word) {
      var low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      return mid;
    }
  }
  return "word not found";
};

6. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

 var linearSearch = function(collection, target) {
   var result = null, value;
   for(var i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {
     value = collection[i];
     if(value === target){
       result = i;
       break;
     }
   }
   return result;
 };
